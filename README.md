# Personal Projects

Welcome to my github, where I list some recent projects.

# [Reinforcement Learning Implementation of Trade Execution](https://github.com/mmkidd/MFE_AFP/blob/master/AFP_final.pdf)

My group's submission for the Applied Finance Project, a capstone project for the Berkeley Master's of Financial Engineering (MFE). Highlights of this project include an implementation of a limit order book (LOB) simulator, which we then use as a training environment for an RL agent to learn how to execute market and limit orders. Our results find comparable performance to mathematical modeling in the literature.

# [Bankruptcy Prediction](https://github.com/mmkidd/bankruptcy_prediction/blob/master/bankruptcy_project.pdf)

This project was my final submission to Udacity's Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree. During the project, I used financial statement data to predict bankruptcy in Polish companies. The data originates with Zieba, Tomczak & Tomczak (2016), and I was able to improve on the classification rate with statistical significance using ensemble methods with LightGBM that have been developed sinced the original source publication.


# Two Sigma Kaggle Competition

In this competition, we had to predict stock returns from news sentiment and price history. The competition submissions had to be coded in Kaggle's web API, so my submissions and analysis cannot be uploaded on github, instead see my contributions here:

[(Link)](https://www.kaggle.com/mmkidd/two-sigma-pre-and-post-processing-discussion) An analysis of pre- and post-processing methods, including some discussion on the limitations of the competition. 

# [FX Carry Trade Processing](https://github.com/mmkidd/carry_processing)

This project is a study in transforming FX spot/forward rates in to carry returns, and constructing simple portfolios using mean-variance optimization. The project is built in R, and uses the pfanalytics package for constrained optimization. The data is spot/forward rates for emering markets from Bloomberg (not included in the repo).
