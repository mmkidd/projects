# Bankruptcy Prediction




# Two Sigma Kaggle Competition

In this competition, we had to predict stock returns from news sentiment and price history. The competition submissions had to be coded in Kaggle's web API, so my submissions and analysis cannot be uploaded on github, instead see my contributions here:

<link 1> An analysis of pre- and post-processing methods, including some discussion on the limitations of the competition. 

<link 2> An exploration of using clustering methods to improve feature engineering.
