# Side Projects

Welcome to my github, where I list some recent projects.

# [Bankruptcy Prediction](https://github.com/mmkidd/bankruptcy_prediction/blob/master/bankruptcy_project.pdf)

This project was my final submission to Udacity's Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree. During the project, I used financial statement data to predict bankruptcy in Polish companies. The data originates with Zieba, Tomczak & Tomczak (2016), and I was able to improve on the classification rate with statistical significance using ensemble methods with LightGBM that have been developed sinced the original source publication.


# Two Sigma Kaggle Competition

In this competition, we had to predict stock returns from news sentiment and price history. The competition submissions had to be coded in Kaggle's web API, so my submissions and analysis cannot be uploaded on github, instead see my contributions here:
